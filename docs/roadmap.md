# Development roadmap

This roadmap orders work by the evidence needed for later claims. A numerical
or physical interpretation should not be implemented before the structural and
evaluation layers can expose its supporting evidence.

## Implemented foundation

- Public `MOI.ModelLike` snapshot boundary with optional direct JuMP support.
- Evidence-first findings with independent severity, issue domain, evidence
  basis, and confidence.
- Static checks for bounds, fixed variables, constant constraints, constant
  domain failures, exact duplicate constraints, and disconnected variables.
- Reusable variable-support extraction for scalar and vector MOI functions.
- Variable–constraint bipartite graph with scalar rows for coordinate-wise
  product sets and block vertices for coupled vector sets.
- Exact connected components, including vector-row identity, coupled-set
  semantics, and explicit handling of incomplete function support.
- Explicit free/fixed/parameter/infeasible variable roles and
  equality/inequality/free/coupled/opaque constraint roles.
- Deterministic maximum-cardinality equality matching.
- Unmatched free-variable and equality-node findings.
- Initial under-, well-, and over-determined Dulmage–Mendelsohn partition.
- Irreducible square blocks for the well-determined partition.
- Renderer-neutral structural graph data with deterministic text and Graphviz
  DOT renderers.
- Normalized expression-node paths with objective, constraint, and vector-row
  provenance.
- Conservative interval propagation from declared variable domains.
- Proven and possible domain findings for logarithms, square roots, division,
  inverse, and integer/fractional powers.
- Extension hooks for custom operator ranges and domain requirements.
- Explicit numerical evaluation points with stable MOI variable ordering.
- Capability discovery for symbolic functions, `AbstractNLPEvaluator`, and
  `VectorNonlinearOracle` sources.
- Point-tagged value, objective-gradient, and sparse-Jacobian cache.
- Exception-safe callback probing and non-finite numerical findings.
- Operating-point domain findings distinct from static interval conclusions.
- Jacobian row/column infinity norms, zero sensitivities, and scale-spread
  findings with duplicate sparse entries combined additively.
- Guarded dense-SVD Jacobian rank, conditioning, and left/right nullspace
  estimates with explicit scaling and threshold evidence.
- Exact callback and labeled finite-difference Hessian-of-the-Lagrangian
  evaluation, plus explicit-active-row reduced-Hessian inertia checks.
- Scalar and coordinate-wise product-bound feasibility margins, explicit
  active-row selection, local LICQ rank checks, and conservative MFCQ
  common-descent witnesses.
- Structural-to-numerical equality-rank comparison that distinguishes expected
  structural rectangular freedom from additional local rank loss.
- Conservative non-unit circular-equality normalization hints for exact
  unshifted isotropic quadratic forms.
- Separate first- and second-derivative domain requirements with custom
  operator extension hooks.
- Inverse trigonometric, hyperbolic, and periodic primitive-domain coverage.
- Floating-point overflow/underflow checks parameterized by numeric type.
- Stable-expression fingerprints for `log1p`, `expm1`, softplus, and logistic
  formulations.
- Complete MOI initialization-point ingestion without implicit default values.
- Initialization bound, value-domain, derivative-domain, non-finite, and
  scaling checks.
- Research profiling matrix derived from unbalanced OPF benchmarking and
  three-phase formulation studies.

## Next: structural refinement

- Add a separately labeled active-set matching after numerical evaluation is
  available.
- Replace simple fixed-variable classification with a richer variable-domain
  intersection abstraction for non-`Float64` coefficient types.
- Benchmark the prototype matching and strongly connected-component
  algorithms on large sparse models before treating them as production-scale
  implementations.

## Next: numerical rank and derivative refinement

- Exact first derivatives for ordinary scalar nonlinear functions through a
  constructed MOI nonlinear evaluator, retaining finite differences as an
  independently labeled check.
- Sparse large-model rank-estimation strategy and dense fallback thresholds.
- General coupled-set and plugin-supplied active-set semantics.
- Full MFCQ failure certificates and multiplier complementarity diagnostics.
- Sparse large-model profiling aggregates.

## Degeneracy framework

Numerical nullspaces are compared with structural results before any
plugin-supplied expected-gauge interpretation. Implemented generic
classifications include structurally expected local nullspaces and unexpected
local rank loss, candidate common-coordinate shifts, and candidate two-row
equation dependencies. Next classifications:

- expected coordinate gauge;
- dependent active constraints;
- flat reduced-Hessian direction; and
- unknown.

PowerModels and multiconductor semantics follow only after these generic
interfaces are stable.
